		<p>
			<center>If you want to know "Why us?" then you must not be in the know. Knowing about our business is nothing of yours, and it will stay that way.<br>
            Think of it as an exclusive club, one that you weren't invited to.<br>
            I know its hard, but maybe you should try being someone important.<br>
            Someone like John Cena, he's cool cause you cant see him.</center>
